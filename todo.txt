press and drag neuron onto another neuron to merge them, (averaging their inputs and adding their outputs) or subtractions
long press to delete neuron
double press to add a neuron to that layer (random inputs, 0 for weight to outputs)

"trim" button to have the program do the above?

a txt file containing the "startup" settings (for both android and windows)
 - neuron radius, font size, thicknessmultiplier, selectedneuron value graph "dot" size
 - and testcase (number or some funky user-inputted equation)

make decimal always in the same spot, to make it easier to see how weights are changing, and about the average neuron value

add realoutputs graph thing to compare

add add text area to networkdisplay

save network and load network

give training data from text input

glitches when minimized and maximized

arrows on weights so it's obvious where the data's going after neurons have been dragged around

remake QA
